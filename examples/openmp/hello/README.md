These five examples illustrate a simple hello world program executing in five different modes:

hello1: On the CPU
hello2: In parallel on the CPU distributed across threads
hello3: On the GPU 
hello4: In parallel on the GPU distrubuted across threads
hello5: In parallel on the GPU distributed across teams and threads
