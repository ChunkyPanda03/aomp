This test case builds a shared object with a target region.
However, with the old --opaque-offload-linker we get this fail. 

free(): double free detected in tcache 2

Using the cmake arge --no-opaque-offload-linker which uses clang-linker-wrapper
will correct this fail.  The target region is not necessary to make this fail.
